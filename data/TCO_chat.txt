[21/06/21, 7:04:04 PM] Dastagir Sir: Very recently, we had an exciting experience in placing Persons with Disability (PwD) in the Technology Space last quarter. Growing demand in IT domain has created job opportunities with skill sets varying from Java Testing to Application Development to SAP to Scrum and many more. Product and BFSI giants are emerging as Diversity leaders in the market which opens doors for talent and right skills that the PwD community holds.
 
Last quarter, we created opportunities for 12 candidates who could meet their dream jobs with top brands in Automobile & Banking sector. The candidates showed immense attitude to learn resulting in these opportunities. It is true that barriers truly exists in our mindsets and not capabilities of an individual. Lend a hand of support and you will be surprised at the outcome of these efforts.

[22/06/21, 8:38:40 AM] Dastagir Sir: #performance #diversityandinclusion #BeyondDisability

*First Drop Theatre* presents *The 'I' in Inclusion*, an *online Playback Theatre performance*.

*Date & Time -  27th June (Sunday), 5:30 pm India time*

*Register at* -  https://bit.ly/3iOvr0t 

*About the Show:*
We had a dream - to go beyond the barriers of disabilities as we create a team of Playback theatre performers. It sat with us for a while, growing, but was not getting a shape.

And then came the pandemic and the world, for all of us, became tiny windows on our digital screens. So do we hit pause on our dream? Or was this the time to reach out without the boundaries of space? We chose the latter and the dream now had a shape; a team. A team that did not let disabilities - physical, visual - come in the way of exploring their passion.

The journey is still on but like in all journeys there are some key moments. Here's one for this team - their second public performance and this time for a wider audience! The theme is one that gave birth to the dream in the first place - inclusion.
That's our story and we would love to hear your voice, on inclusion, through your real-life stories. Through this show, we invite you to share your personal 'inclusion' stories with us - of moments where you felt included and of those where you yearned to be, of moments where you could be an ally to someone and those moments where you could not. And then watch as the actors make your stories come alive, on-the-spot!

*Playback Theatre* - Magical, creative, thought-provoking, reflective, unscripted...just like life itself. A format of improvisational, interactive theatre where the actors use their creativity and skill, to present an engaging and dramatized retelling of the audience member's story on-the-spot. We have adapted it for the online space.

*Image description:* On an ivory background, right hand upper corner there is multicolored thumb print. On the left hand upper corner, there is logo of First Drop Theatre. On the left hand corner, starting from mid poster, the following is written : First Drop Theatre presents, The 'I' in Inclusion, An online Playback Theatre performance. 
Below this, following details are given: on Zoom, 27 June 2021, Time 5:30pm IST, Pay what you can. Register at https://bit.ly/3iOvr0t  or mail to firstdrop.theatre@gmail.com

*Note* - This is a 'pay what you can' event and the Zoom link would be mailed to you once you register.

Or 
For few days use prosthetic along with elbow crutches to reduce load.

2. In case you put on weight and socket fitting is not comfortable nowadays, reduce weight: workout and reduce calories/mainly dinner

3. Prosthetic is mechanical assembly. Sometime change in alignment (for example, joint-socket connection slipped little due to some impact) may also change pressure point, hence, more pressure at specific area.
Or in case you have changed shoes.
Realignment or shoe pad adjustment required.

[18/07/21, 12:24:43 PM] Balachandra Hegde: Just wanted to share my personal experience in getting sweat inside the socket. I am using a suction socket. Whenever I get sweat, I use to feel looseness in the socket. Then I use to remove the suction valve and just clean the sweat accumulated at the bottom of the socket with a cloth. Then put the valve back and continue the physical activity.  Later I realised that while putting the limb it self, make sure there is no space left in side the socket. After following this, now there is no sweat and no looseness in the socket. So I feel, if one is getting lot of sweat in side the socket, then that means there is some air space between the socket and the stump which might be the cause for sweat.

[04/08/21, 5:47:10 PM] Dastagir Sir: After receiving your prosthesis and ensuring your socket and alignment are fine-tuned, maintain this balance through regular prosthetic visits. Also, maintain your current weight as much as possible. Weight gain or loss can affect the balance between your socket and alignment, keeping you from enjoying your prosthetic system to the fullest. Read more: https://zcu.io/wS2L
[04/08/21, 5:47:10 PM] Dastagir Sir: The human body's size and weight fluctuate throughout the day. This can make it difficult to achieve residual limb stability. But one thing you can do is wear prosthetic shrinkers at night, and on days you don't use your prosthesis. A shrinker can help keep your residual limb volume stable. Read more: https://zcu.io/WUzu
[04/08/21, 5:47:11 PM] Dastagir Sir: A loose prosthetic socket can create a whole host of issues that affect the function and comfort of your prosthesis. Symptoms include feeling pressure along a bone or increased lower back pain, among others. Read more: https://zcu.io/7B1y
[04/08/21, 5:47:11 PM] Dastagir Sir: If you use a prosthesis, working on improving your balance offers benefits beyond preventing a fall. Improved prosthetic balance means a significant improvement in the quality of your walking, which lessens injuries and reduces lower back pain. Read more: https://zcu.io/RZ9j

You can keep yourself comfortable and prevent overheating by choosing clothes made from breathable fabrics, like cotton and linen. Read more: https://zcu.io/YCVV

This tip is excellent for prosthesis users who require more energy to walk or move with a prosthetic limb—expending more energy results in more body heat, thus more sweat.

The line should bisect the heel of your prosthetic foot or fall slightly to the inside. Read more: https://zcu.io/zfCM

"After amputation, they go through depression. When they do these activities again, they go through an awakening and realize that they can do the things they used to do, albeit a bit different."

[03/09/21, 10:23:08 AM] Dastagir Sir: Message received from Ottobock India

Amputees face 65% more skin related issues compared to people without amputations. Although skin care and issue handling guidelines exist globally, no such document exists for India. Also, clinicians as well as dermatologists consider this as unfamiliar territory and as a result issues are handled without teamwork between these three stakeholders.

At Ottobock, we are trying to collate a guideline about skin care & common skin issues for a. patients b. Clinicians with help of a senior dermatologist who is also a user of Ottobock device.

We have already collated data from approx. 60-70 of our users and more from our clinicians. But of course more data will help make our guideline more sharper, encompassing. Hence, requesting you to share with all the users from ‘The Challenging ones’. Data will stay confidential and Ottobock will not try to contact these users to make commercial offers.

The outcome of the survey will be shared with all those participating in the survey. We will conduct a live session with the consultant Dermatologist who will be available as a knowledge resource. He will also be available for online paid consultations to those interested independently.

Here is the Hindi survey: https://forms.gle/PShYtVYQyd78Gcoz8

[14/09/21, 8:27:51 PM] Dastagir Sir: Energy drinks are great for when you need a short-term energy boost. Studies show that energy drinks can provide benefits that go beyond reducing sleepiness, including boosting concentration and memory by about 24%. However, the regular consumption of this caffeine- and sugar-filled cocktail may lead to reduced energy levels. Read more: https://zcu.io/qfuJ

I have a question..
Is it possible for right leg below knee amputee to drive regular cars?
[17/09/21, 8:36:42 AM] ‪+91 98400 41062‬: Possible but will be a little difficult,  better that person can try automatic transmission car as only 1 leg is reqd to control the brake and accelator
[17/09/21, 10:03:40 AM] ‪+91 91 487 504 45‬: I know some amputees, who are unilateral above knee amputee driving regular car.It completely depends on confidence..If someone  think thy are not confident enough better to go for automatic transmission for safety  purposes
[17/09/21, 10:07:34 AM] ‪+91 81791 16926‬: Hi this is JAGADISH
even am a right leg below knee amputee . I will drive regular car but it will be difficult in traffic areas . better I suggest you to go through automatic car which is easy to drive.
[17/09/21, 10:10:07 AM] ‪+91 95377 77940‬: Well, depends on ur amputed limb condition.

If you feel, it is strong enough, it will be easy for you to drive.

Else, next to options are
1. Buy automatic transmissions car.

2. Convert ur manual car to automatic with additional clutch kit
[17/09/21, 10:10:32 AM] ‪+91 96590 28329‬: Yes. I am driving without any difficulty. I personally feel sedan is better than hatchback or suv. Sedan gives you a comfortable seating and leg position than suv or hatchback.
[17/09/21, 10:12:02 AM] ‪+91 97474 74488‬: Yes it is I'm a right leg below knee amputee, you have to make certain adjustments, u can make both accelerator and brake in hands on by installing a special lever near steering by an modification expert. They will help you to attain modification work papers from RTO. I had altered an 2012 model indica V2 ls and driven successfully. Thereby you only need to control clutch by left leg. The modified car can be used by normal people also because the clutch,brake & accelerator will not be removed for the alteration...it costed me 15,000 extra for adding this modification in Kerala.
[17/09/21, 11:07:02 AM] ‪+91 97474 74488‬: Sir I have an indica V2 Ls 2012 model is with me which I altered, due to my financial problems I want to sell it. I have uninstalled the extra fittings, but still can be installed if someone in need.  Expected price is 80,000. Can you help me if someone need a car
[17/09/21, 11:07:02 AM] ‪+91 97474 74488‬: Car is once used as a taxi and now it's a private car under my ownership.
[17/09/21, 11:07:03 AM] ‪+91 97474 74488‬: Car still gives 24 litre mileage and it's a diesel vehicle.

[17/09/21, 12:13:16 PM] Balachandra Hegde: Please make sure you have valid license for driving. If vehicle is registered as LMV then you should have valid LMV license. Otherwise when it comes to the insurance claim for any reason, it may create an issue.
[17/09/21, 12:15:01 PM] ‪+91 93946 96502‬: But they won't allow us to get driving license like regular ones... They said you have car on your name to get license... 😤
[17/09/21, 1:09:22 PM] Balachandra Hegde: This is for invalid carriage license only I think. For LMV license, the car need not be in your name. And it is difficult to get a LMV license for PwDs
[17/09/21, 1:20:03 PM] ‪+91 93946 96502‬: Is it easy to get invalid carriage license?
[17/09/21, 1:22:40 PM] Balachandra Hegde: I got it easily in 1997. Now you have to buy a vehicle then register it as invalid carriage vehicle then apply for license. Not sure if anything has changed recently
[17/09/21, 1:22:58 PM] ‪+91 97474 74488‬: Yes it is , it will be easy if you're having a invalid carriage vehicle in your name. Contact an agent or go directly to RTO office
[17/09/21, 1:36:05 PM] ‪+91 98402 50900‬: I'm also below knee amputation. Butt freely drive manual cars.
[17/09/21, 1:53:08 PM] ‪+91 97474 74488‬: A handicapped person will only get invalid carriage license in India. In Kerala, local governing body such as Panchayat, Municipalities and Corporations provides invalid carriage vehicle for the disabled free of cost under certain schemes. You need to apply for it through your local governing body. There by obtaining a invalid carriage vehicle in your name you can apply for invalid carriage license at your RTO office. If you're looking for a car you should buy it yourself and make the alteration, then you can go for license. Against all odds some people are gifted and they still rides cars and bikes without taking invalid carriage license and making the alterations. But it's against law and will be fined. But frankly saying I'm a right leg below knee amputee  I have a bullet and rides it since I started using prosthetic leg in 2015.

[17/09/21, 2:10:25 PM] Balachandra Hegde: You can apply for GST concession certificate. If you get a GST concession certificate then vehicle should be considered as an adaptive vehicle.

[01/10/21, 11:25:35 AM] Dastagir Sir: Getting a prosthetic device, whether it's your first or you're replacing an old one, can be exciting, scary, and frustrating all at the same time. It's easy to get overwhelmed with all the information out there, so we answered some FAQs to help you decide whether you want to get a prosthesis and what to expect once you have your device.  Read more: https://zcu.io/wSII
[01/10/21, 11:25:37 AM] Dastagir Sir: Chronic back pain is identified as one of the common complaints of American adults, along with headaches, joint pain, and nerve pain. While not fatal as other chronic conditions, back pain, especially along the lower back, makes the lives of many prosthetic users miserable. Read more: https://zcu.io/bt9B
[01/10/21, 11:25:38 AM] Dastagir Sir: Mindfulness improves your mindset, which is helpful when you’re trying to find the silver lining in everything life gives you. It prevents you from being bogged down and overwhelmed by unnecessary and negative noises in your head. https://zcu.io/Z0CH
[01/10/21, 11:25:39 AM] Dastagir Sir: Disbelief, shock, anxiety, anger, and feelings of loss—these are just a few emotions that come with news of cancer recurrence. No one is ever prepared for it, even though many cancer survivors constantly live with the fear of the disease returning. The emotional trauma of going through all the surgeries and treatments again is unimaginable. Read more: https://zcu.io/n7lc

[03/10/21, 6:57:29 PM] Dastagir Sir: Walking meditation is a great way to take care of your body and mind.

Those who practice walking meditation report feeling more grounded, serene, and balanced. Read more: https://zcu.io/XyLL

[06/10/21, 12:10:05 PM] Dastagir Sir: Unlike mechanical prostheses, microprocessor systems are designed to move and even think the way biological systems do. This explains why those who wear microprocessor-enabled prostheses do not need to consciously direct their prostheses during the different elements of walking, including weight-bearing, swinging, or knee flexion. These smart devices make constant adjustments so the user can quickly adapt to different terrains. Read more: https://zcu.io/UWQ3

[06/10/21, 12:10:06 PM] Dastagir Sir: Talking about your problems is good for your brain and body, and science proves it. Your intense feelings occur in the amygdala, a part of the brain that is also responsible for your fight or flight response. When you feel overwhelmed or stressed, the amygdala can override logical thought processes. This explains why you often make impulsive decisions when you feel overwhelmed.

[14/10/21, 7:58:06 PM] Dastagir Sir: INSIGHT is comprised of laser scanning, wearable technology, and a mobile app. The laser scanning creates a precise 3D model of a prosthetic socket's inner surface in under 90 seconds. The wearable technology gathers biodata and identifies problematic points during the fitting. Meanwhile, the mobile app allows prosthetists to track their patients' history and fitting process through the entire rehabilitation phase. Simply put, the system tracks possible prosthetic issues even before the prosthetic user notices anything. Read more: https://zcu.io/XbTW

But this is about to change as researchers work on the Veteran Amputee Skin Regeneration Program, which explores cell therapy and how it could enable prosthetic users to wear their prostheses comfortably for much longer.

[16/11/21, 7:16:23 PM] Dastagir Sir: https://www.amputee-coalition.org/resources/choosing-the-right-shoe/

Uncontrolled diabetes and the resulting high blood sugar levels lead to nerve degeneration, or neuropathy. This loss of feeling usually starts at the extremities, in the hands and feet, so particular attention needs to be paid to any wounds or lesions that may begin to develop there. Because of the repetitive stresses and constant weight on the feet during walking, the foot is the main site for ulceration for patients with peripheral neuropathy. It is also difficult to heal these foot ulcers because most patients want to remain active and prefer not to sit around waiting for wounds to close.

However, this may soon be a thing of the past. A team of researchers recently discovered that neural control of a robotic prosthetic ankle could restore a wide range of functions in prosthesis users.

[23/11/21, 8:27:51 PM] Dastagir Sir: The Great Place to Work®️ FOR ALL Summit is the largest and the most sought-after event in the space of workplace culture in India, with CEOs, CHROs and other business professionals from over 20 industries attending this event. The Summit aims to bring to you an opportunity to interact with leaders from across the globe who have successfully built and sustained High-Trust, High-Performance Cultures™️ in their organizations. These leaders have not just been able to survive during these challenging times but have also created workplace cultures that inspire innovation!

Theme
The theme for this year is “Workplaces Of The Future.” Over the last two years, individuals and organizations have undergone tremendous changes while dealing with the uncertainty brought by the pandemic. While there was no universally applicable playbook, FOR ALL leaders and organizations acknowledged the power of agility and adaptability in sustaining a High-Trust, High-Performance™️ workplace culture. Our research shows that agility and adaptability are essential not just to manoeuvre through a crisis but also to provide a competitive advantage. We see that agility in an organization gives rise to innovation and the lack thereof, hampers its ability to adapt to the changes.

Date: 10th and 11th February, 2022.

[30/11/21, 7:05:10 PM] Dastagir Sir: Researchers found that the sensor could accurately detect changes in the prosthetic socket fit way before the prosthetist did. They also concluded that using a sensor that can detect volume changes even before they manifest may be helpful towards post-amputation rehabilitation. Read more: https://zcu.io/2uL9
[30/11/21, 7:05:10 PM] Dastagir Sir: The disparity in employment rates between persons with disabilities & the remaining workforce hinders their poverty alleviation. A research team from #IITMadras conducted a study based on the differences in employment rates among persons with disabilities, arising from the diverse nature of their disabilities. The study captures stereotype views or unconscious biases that act as a deterrent to hiring them.

Since 80% of persons with disabilities globally are in developing countries like India with most of them being less educated, under/unemployed and poor, which hinder their poverty alleviation. As employers play a critical role in promoting the employment of people with disabilities, this study explored leaders’ perspectives on key factors that direct their decisions regarding the targeted recruitment of persons with various types of disabilities. This study will aid in providing not only sustained livelihood but also in enhancing the standard of living for persons with disabilities toward a more equitable distribution of income in society. Workplace disability inclusion requires moving beyond a mere acknowledgement to more strategic intent and implementation of universal design principles, toward sustainable inclusion of persons with diverse disabilities into the mainstream.

One good news to share with all TCO family members

TCO North members Ankita Srivastava and Kawalpreet Singh became life partners on November 27, 2021. 

Very happy to know that TCO was the link between them which became stronger when both met in AIIMS.

Hope to see many more members having life partners who can understand their difficulties and bond together for the lifetime.

Congrats and Happy Married Life 💐💐💐

[02/12/21, 4:00:36 PM] Dastagir Sir: Previous studies have shown that people with lower-limb loss rely more on visual feedback to maintain balance than able-bodied individuals.

[08/12/21, 7:41:31 PM] Dastagir Sir: Above-knee amputation is known to reduce mobility and quality of life severely. This is mainly because the surgery removes much of the leg’s muscles. To help solve this problem, engineers created an experimental exoskeleton that could make moving and walking more manageable for many individuals with above-knee limb loss.

[09/12/21, 4:13:09 PM] ‪+91 91 487 504 45‬: Hello Guys..Sharing a sad experience  with you all..

I got many queries about artificial  centre on Instagram  ..Some amputees ask  suggestions after  checking  my posts on Instagram ,some think that I may  use high end artificial limbs.But I choose to ignore all those queries till date .Do u know why? Just let me tell u my side story and also sharing my pathetic experience  yesterday in ENDOLITE INDIA LTD Hyderabad 

I went to Endolite Artificial limb centre HYDERABAD yesterday to do some slight adjustments in artificial foots for shoes. 

It was my biggest mistake to ask their help for shoe adjustments as these artificial limbs centres in India don't allow us to do shoe alignment. 
I never falled down last 15years while standing but after I went to this centre and don't knows what they did with my limbs.I am not able to get any balance while walking and falled down twice while standing.It is beyond frustrating to see these prosthetist's knowledge.They took 3 hours to do a small adjustment and even after that result is pathetic. 
I was never been in centre after I took these limbs and used to do  adjustments on my own with papers or cut shoe sole.This time  I thought if I take their help may be I can walk better but things came out completely different. 

If this  is the condition of a Indian artificial centre in proper city that also from ENDOLITE INDIA LTD then where we would go for major changes?
We amputees in India has potential to walk normally but I guess it is hard to find a good prosthetist here who could help us.Infact I think  they only take care of high valued customers initially after that I don't  have idea about  their services.
How could we even think or suggest someone to spend lacs on artificial limbs from our hard earned  money to this kind of  centres. 

This is the reason I choose to ignore as   I couldn't direct someone to such kind of  centres knowing the reality.

[10/12/21, 2:27:53 AM] ‪+1 (647) 321‑1993‬: From my overall 7 years of experience as an amputee in Hyderabad i confirm this is true and capitalism is the major cause! Why aren't amputees hired to deal with other amputees? No experience neither lack of understanding the exact pain and cause these prosthetic centers charge so much! I'm in an awe to see so many options and helping hands reaching out for help but nun actually helps ease disability. Isn't the prosthetic should be cheap and affordable for common pple ?

[10/12/21, 10:04:39 AM] ‪+91 98862 92002‬: Even I have experienced samething at Endolite Bangalore’s centre they totally refused to fix my issue even for temporarily. They were asking to change whole system immediately I swear guys until unless you shower money on them they never help you. This has happened to me 2-3 ago their main agenda is just about making money. I even noticed when you are a new customer they treat you like a God. Then gradually keep you ripping off with so many things and treat you lower than human being , especially ENDOLITE.
[10/12/21, 10:07:32 AM] ‪+91 91 487 504 45‬: Seriously, these artificial limbs are so important in our life.Not sure when they realize our problems and act accordingly.I think only amputee can understand another fellow amputee's  issues.It is impossible to understand another problem unless we went through  the same.
[10/12/21, 10:07:39 AM] ‪+91 98862 92002‬: We should totally refrain using ENDOLITE or at least we should keep informed at main branch about these things I’m sure they are not aware of these things happening in India 🇮🇳

[10/12/21, 10:15:09 AM] Balachandra Hegde: Endolite India clinical head Mr Gautam Jain is here in this group. Hope he is seeing your messages and take necessary corrective action. @919873137603
[10/12/21, 10:17:06 AM] ‪+91 87908 00838‬: I visit Endolite Hyd frequently, if we take appointment an also the service delivery time will be same, for small things like shoe alignment also they took 3-4 hours minimum. Who traveling from other places to hyd it will be difficult to return to back to home. And another issue is every time we visit to center new prosthetist will guide you.
[10/12/21, 10:18:39 AM] ‪+91 98862 92002‬: Last time I even brought my issue into his notice. To be honest I was kinda stalled in Mangalore’s centre when Mr. Jain spoke to them. I’m not making this up this is what I have experienced.
[10/12/21, 11:14:03 AM] Balachandra Hegde: My thoughts on prosthesis companies in India

Whether it is Endolite or OttoBock or any other company, they have set-up their office here only for fitment, they don't manufacture any of the components. They import all the components and do the fitment here. In my 33 years of amputee experience, what I understand now is fitment is the most important than the components. Any one can buy a C-Leg, but if the fitment of socket is not correct then the entire C-Leg will become unusable. So the question is, are the prosthetist in these companies are trained well to do the fitment? The answer is yes and no, because the prosthetist hired by these companies are working there for salary. If prosthetist is good and not getting enough work or not having good salary, they will leave the company and start working where they good salary and the work. And even if the prosthetist is having good knowledge, when they are working in a company, they have to recommend their products only. These companies will have a target to run the business. They will have to recover the operating cost from the people visiting their office. So when new patient comes they welcome them very nicely whereas when the existing patient comes they know they won't get money like thay get with the new patients. So first few visit they talk nicely as the time passes they try to avoid the existing patient's issues, they try to sell the new product rather than correcting the problem. This is purely a business model.
[10/12/21, 11:55:19 AM] ‪+91 98862 92002‬: I understand it’s a business model all I’m saying is don’t rip us off mercilessly and keep insisting us to buy new products ✅ that’s all my concern
[10/12/21, 12:08:07 PM] Balachandra Hegde: True, but if the current prosthetist doesn't know much about the old prosthesis used by us, then that is what they say. Buy a new one is the easiest solution they can offer instead of trying to correct something which they are not comfortable in doing it
[10/12/21, 12:10:33 PM] ‪+91 98862 92002‬: True that 👍✌️
[10/12/21, 12:16:28 PM] ‪+91 98650 35915‬: The person who fitted me the artificial limb saying he is no more doing the product so he won't service and if i want his service he insisted me to buy new brand what can I do for that only this people are money minded
[10/12/21, 12:31:54 PM] Balachandra Hegde: That means he has changed the company. So he is not comfortable in servicing the product he had done earlier. So he is trying to sell new product. For example when I first took my Artificial limb from Endolite, that time everyone over there told this is best limb after 4 years when I visited them for some service, the best limb they provided 4 years back, now started looking like problematic limb now. Everyone who said best limb 4 years back started saying this limb is not so good, you buy this new limb now. How come one of the best limb 4 years back became not a good limb now? This is how they run the business.
[10/12/21, 12:33:12 PM] ‪+91 91 487 504 45‬: There shouldn't be such target pressure for these employees in artificial limb centre.I heard that  sometimes they compell to do such things to save their jobs.But not sure about that.Artificial limbs are not luxury and we don't  have insurance in India.

[02/01/22, 6:21:31 PM] Dastagir Sir: Prosthetic shrinkers or compression shrinker socks compress the residual limb, promoting lymph flow, which reduces tissue swelling. All these swelling reductions also mitigate any discomfort on your residual limb itself caused by squeezed nerves. Read more: https://zcu.io/6yjT
[02/01/22, 6:21:32 PM] Dastagir Sir: The prosthetic socket connects your residual limb to the prosthetic limb, making it an essential aspect of a prosthetic system. So far, technological advancement has only produced powered knees and feet, but these are useless without a good-fitting prosthetic socket. Read more: https://zcu.io/mEJ2

Prof. Sujatha Srinivasan, Prof. Sundararajan Natarajan, and Mr. TM Balakrishanan from the Department of Mechanical Engineering, #IITMadras have used finite element analysis (FEA), a technique used to arrive at the critical parameters of a physical system numerically.

The use of FEA in the design of prosthetic feet is a first and takes into account the geometric, material, and contact non-linearity of a prosthetic foot. The 3d printed legs are a combination of mathematics and engineering.

My name is Omkar and I am 21 Yrs/M. I am here to raise funds for myself. I am a student. I live in Pune, Maharashtra with my parents & siblings. I met with an accident last year and my leg had to be amputated above the knee. I am yet to get fitted with an artificial limb in Artificial Limb Centre. I need Rs.3,00,000.00 more for the artificial limb fitting. Please contribute and share.

[21/01/22, 10:11:28 AM] Dastagir Sir: Muscles imbalances, including muscle strength and length, have been documented in amputees. This is common in above-knee amputees who walk with a prosthetic limb with an improper degree of socket flexion, causing an exaggerated lower back arching. Read more: https://zcu.io/eXe3
[21/01/22, 10:11:28 AM] Dastagir Sir: You cannot rely on a great prosthetic socket fit alone to solve all your prosthetic-related problems. This is where amputee supplies come in handy. Balms or salves can help when scars or skin grafted areas experience friction against the prosthetic limb. Meanwhile, prosthetic sleeves or liners can make your leg feel more secure and lighter. Change them regularly as needed. Read more: https://zcu.io/HQN6

[23/01/22, 4:35:10 PM] Balachandra Hegde: Hi Ajay
Don't look at the brand. Just look at what are all activities you would like to do and based on that you can choose the components. It is the fitment which gives you better experience of using prosthesis rather than brand. I am one of the victim of going with brand and wrong notion of thinking microprocessor based knee joints will make my walking better. But it is not at all true. The first thing is you have to look at the fitment. If the fitment is good then you can do lot of things with basic ones.

[24/01/22, 7:41:03 PM] Dastagir Sir: Improving residual limb stability calls for a healthy diet to keep weight within a healthy range. Bodyweight fluctuations can wreak havoc on overall residual limb health and skin integrity. Maintaining your weight will extend the life of your prosthetic limb. Otherwise, you will need a new prosthetic socket after gaining 20-30lbs. Read more: https://zcu.io/s4DI

It makes me happy from inside when I check my students are doing Surya Namaskar with one leg with or without  prosthesis. So,I just don't want to limited it within my students who are paying me.I am trying hard to make it possible for every amputee.

So that we can build a differently abled Yoga community . This program is directed and funded by Yoga Alliance
[03/02/22, 11:13:42 AM] Dastagir Sir: Changes in the side-to-side movement of a prosthetic foot along the frontal plane can negatively impact your knee. When this remains uncorrected for a long time, you can expect issues that can lead to long-term deterioration of the knee joint. This is true regardless of whether you wear an above- or below-knee prosthesis. Read more: https://zcu.io/cXJR
[03/02/22, 11:13:42 AM] Dastagir Sir: When the foot is positioned too far back, a prosthetic user would feel minimal "toe" resistance and little to no energy return overall. This usually creates knee instability and a soft mushy feeling in the prosthetic foot—not ideal when you're running to catch the bus or playing sports. Read more: https://zcu.io/vkSI
[03/02/22, 11:13:43 AM] Dastagir Sir: When your prosthetic foot is rotated too far outward, you lose its toe function. You'll notice this when you take a step, and you feel as if you stepped into a hole. Having your prosthetist turn your foot in a few degrees can bring back the toe resistance.

Not to fear! I am taking a "Squash Episode" & will post it on Friday.
I'm playing my Vidya Mandir batchmate's son in Round 1. A fantastic Junior player who has now transitioned to "Mens". Last week, I meant it as a figure of speech when I predicted, "I'll be playing someone old enough to be my son". Well, that has come true. 🐮

I never touch upon my disadvantages when I step on Court. I lose 90% of the time but no excuses.
I lost because I wasn't good enough on that day. There is enough condescension towards people with disabilities. Let's change people's mindset, that's my humble desire.

[10/02/22, 1:43:12 PM] Dastagir Sir: The prosthetic liner is the most commonly used component for suspending or cushioning the residual limb within a prosthesis. Often referred to as silicone socks or jelly liners, liners are usually made from gel elastomers and silicone. They are designed to roll up and over the residual limb to protect the skin from friction-related skin injuries and provide positive suspension of the prosthetic limb. Read more: https://zcu.io/UG6o
[10/02/22, 1:43:29 PM] Dastagir Sir: Silicone prosthetic liners are typically preferred by prosthetic users who lead an active lifestyle, as well as those who have softer redundant tissues. This is because silicone-based prosthetic liners provide extra stability resulting from their firmness. Read more: https://zcu.io/6riB

[11/02/22, 9:06:10 PM] Dastagir Sir: Sweat or excessive sweating is one of the most common side effects of wearing a prosthetic liner. New prosthetic liner users can expect about six months of excessive perspiration while their body adjusts to wearing a liner. Unlike socks, liners are not designed to absorb sweat. However, sweating can be minimized by using an underliner sock or prosthetic antiperspirant. Read more: https://zcu.io/4sYv

[16/02/22, 5:23:01 PM] Dastagir Sir: Not too long ago, the straight pylon system was the prosthesis of choice for many prosthetic runners. But running with a straight pylon is like running with locked knees. It forces the body to compensate by circumducting the prosthetic leg (swinging the prosthesis to the side) to clear the prosthetic toe. Running like this for an extended period will eventually injure the hip and back areas. Read more: https://zcu.io/pp3A

Another essential component of your prosthetic running system is the suspension. And the only way to ensure optimal performance is to select a secure suspension system that fits you well.

Dear Members,

As we all are aware that March 8th is Internationally celebrated as International Women’s Day. It is a day to commemorate the cultural, political, and socioeconomic achievements of women and also  is a focal point in the Women's rights movement and enabling a world that’s more diverse, equitable and inclusive.

Paralympic Committee of India is planning to celebrate first 15 days of March as Women’s Day whereby, we would be posting the motivational videos / action photographs/ training videos / small clipping / photographs on our social media handles so that we can introduce them to the world and share there stories through our social media handles.

These clipping can be also be small compilation or videos (maximum of 2 mins) of their training and achievements of female para athletes from all possible states representing different sports. This can be regarding their fight and the struggle against biasness in life towards them and their daily fight for gender equality and how sports have helped them overcome this struggle.

We request all State Associations to please participate in this campaign and send us the stories of their female para athletes, they can be Medal Winners or non-Medal winners.

Kindly feel free to contact Mr Rahul Swami (+919971356683) and Mr Mahavir Rawat (+919560059226) for any help or query in this regard

Let’s all together make this campaign a success !!

[16/03/22, 9:08:21 AM] Dastagir Sir: Feedback from above knee amputee who has been using prosthesis for 10 years regarding Easyfit and Liner

*Easy fit:*
pros 
1. Stump size doesn’t matter. It helps any stump to fit in a socket 
2. Comparatively cheap or economical
3. Quick dry after wash 

Cons 
1. Short life of regularly using and regularly washing
2. Stump direct contact with socket leads to heavy perspiration and friction leading to blisters and injuries
3. Have to buy only from the prosthetic leg vendor. 

*Liner :*
pros
1. Temperature control and creates perfect vacuum making it ideal for heavy physical activities
2. Minimal injuries or wounds initially as it acts as a protective layer between stump and socket
3. Liner brand is not relevant to the socket 

Cons:
1. Expensive
2. Have to wash everyday or regularly to avoid any infection and have to be dried by hanging it on its stand and not like clothes
3. If weight increases and stump size increases, it becomes difficult to fit in socket as the liner creates one layer of thickness

[16/03/22, 5:46:44 PM] Dastagir Sir: Specialized prosthetics for running have enabled athletes with bilateral leg amputations to surpass the qualifying standards for the Olympic 400 m race. Because these adaptive athletes clock in relatively fast finishes, many assume prosthetics provide an unfair advantage over biologically legged competitors. But is there really an unfair advantage? Researchers sought to find out. Read more: https://zcu.io/OrBN

[17/03/22, 9:34:56 PM] Dastagir Sir: Namaste,

I am a Ph.D. scholar at Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics, Pune. I am doing a study on Motor Vehicle accident victims. 

Motor vehicle accidents cause disability and financial burden on the victims. The study is undertaken to take feedback from those who have sustained injuries and disabilities in motor vehicle accidents. The objective is to identify problems faced by the victims in getting medical help, treatment, lifestyle and career changes etc. The same will help me in collecting important data for my Ph.D. as well as design recommendations to the Government of India for policy changes to help the road accident victims. Your cooperation will go a long way in addressing this important issue.

You may leave your name, phone number or address column empty if you do not wish enter those details and proceed to the next question. 

Thank You,

[04/04/22, 11:48:22 AM] Dastagir Sir: One thing people often say to me is how confident I am with my body and how they could never be that way if this were to happen to them. Well, first off, that’s why God chose me for this mission and not someone else. To be the one to show others that you can come back from hell and find joy in life. Second off, I’ve never been one to feel sorry for myself or to play the victim, so that for sure wasn’t going to start now. Lastly, I learned just how fragile life is. It can be gone in an instant. I don’t want to waste what time I may have left being anything less than who I was before. In fact, I’m living my life greater than the Jamie I was on February 6, 2021.

Yes, I miss my body. YES, I miss my leg. Don’t get me wrong, I do struggle sometimes and get frustrated. But I never once have asked “what if I still had my leg?” Because, if you know my story, then you know the answer to that. So, I just give my self Grace and remind myself that my body has survived near death. It has been through massive amounts of trauma. But I am still here.

So, when you look at these two pictures side by side don’t notice what’s missing. Notice what’s still there. The same big smile on my face that I always have! I am so happy to be alive! My life is still worth living even though it’s exponentially harder, it’s extraordinarily incredible.

This is because these joints and muscles must perform additional functions to compensate for any limitations brought by the amputation. These areas are called "compensatory structures." These result in an imbalance in muscle activity, which leads to spasms, stiffness, and tightness in the muscles. Read more: https://zcu.io/7zIH

[02/05/22, 1:08:49 PM] Dastagir Sir: Flexibility is more than just the ability to bend over to touch your toes. If you use a prosthetic limb, improving your flexibility is critical as it helps you prevent injuries and improve your overall prosthetic balance. And if your muscles are well-stretched, you can be sure that you can achieve a full range of motion, making movement easier. Read more: https://zcu.io/qIxT
